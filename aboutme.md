SimYou is a small, passionate group of creators exploring how AI can enhance interactive experiences.

### Our Approach

We're curious researchers and developers interested in finding practical applications for language models. Our work is guided by empirical evidence, collaborative exploration, and a genuine love for what we do.

### What We Do

- Experiment with AI-driven personalized content
- Develop interactive experiences that adapt based on context
- Share what we learn along the way

### Our Values

- **Empirical Science**: We collect meaningful data, measure user interactions, and iterate based on quantifiable results. This evidence-based approach helps us create experiences that actually work rather than just sounding impressive. We apply research-backed understanding of human cognition and behavior to build efficacious designs that resonate with real users.
- **Jolly Cooperation**: We embrace diverse perspectives and collaborative problem-solving to create something greater than any individual could alone. Our team values open communication, constructive feedback, and the willingness to learn from one another. We're committed to fostering an environment where ideas can be freely shared and refined through thoughtful discussion.
- **Fun First**: We believe enjoyment is fundamental to meaningful experiences, not just an afterthought. Our approach prioritizes creating content that's intrinsically engaging and satisfying to interact with. When developers and users alike find genuine pleasure in an experience, everything else—retention, engagement, even learning—follows naturally. We're serious about our work, but never at the expense of the joy that inspired us to build in the first place.

### Who We Are

SimYou isn't a large corporation with lofty promises - we're a small team of enthusiasts combining our skills in technology, design, and storytelling to explore what's possible when AI meets creativity.

We're always learning, often experimenting, and occasionally failing - but we're having a great time doing it.
